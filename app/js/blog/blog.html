            <h6>Going on a backpacking trip can be a large amount of work, but that shouldn’t stop anyone from making the trip a reality. At Pakity, we believe that everyone should let out their inner backpacker, and in this post, we’ll list out our reasons why we believe this.</h6>
            <h5>1. Backpacking gives you a unique way to see the world</h5>
            <p>Backpackers travel the world without restraints. When you’re backpacking, you get the chance to roam the world, and you’ll end up in some amazing (yet somewhat random) places. Embrace the ambiguity, as this is what makes backpacking an amazing experience. You have the ability to control where you go and the path you take to get there--making backpacking one of the best ways to travel.</p>

            <h5>2. You’ll meet make interesting relationships that’ll create lasting memories.</h5>
            <p>When you go backpacking, you’ll return from your trip with a variety of stories. And most of these stories will be about the people you met along the way. You’ll meet people from a variety of backgrounds, and you’ll learn various life lessons that can’t be taught anywhere else. There’s nothing like sitting around with people you’ve met during your trip and connecting with your life stories. </p>

            <h5>3. You’ll become an expert problem solver.</h5>
            <p>Packing a backpack is the same as solving a jigsaw puzzle when you’re first getting started. You have to pack a sleeping bag, clothes, shoes, a tent, food, and a variety of other necessities for survival. This gives you a challenge, but it’s a challenge worth solving. It’s a humbling experience to see everything you need to survive fit into one pack, and backpacking gives you this ability.</p>

            <h5>4. You’ll learn to live in the moment.</h5>
            <p>Living in the moment is one area that people rarely think about. We’re faced with emails, texts, alerts, and a ton of information. It becomes difficult to focus on what’s right in front of you, and people spend so much time looking at information that affects the future. When you’re backpacking, you have to solve problems that are right in front of you, and you’re often in an area where technology isn’t easily accessible. The experience forces you to focus on the moment, and this is something that Pakity believes people should apply to their daily lives.</p>

            <h5>5. Backpacking allows you to re-examine your limits. </h5>
            <p> If you’re in the mood to push yourself, go on a backpacking trip. Backpacking challenges you in ways you’ve never experienced, and you’ll have the chance to push yourself. You’re solving problems everyday, and instead of thinking about materialistic aspects of your life, you’ll be focusing on surviving, meeting new people, and learning. This causes you to change your mindset, and you can definitely be assured that you’ll learn something new about yourself and your limits. </p>
